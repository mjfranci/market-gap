//! HTTP route handlers.

//! The OSS server exposes a deliberately small surface that mirrors the
//! hosted-API JSON shapes where the underlying capability exists in the
//! OSS crates. Endpoints that depend on private infrastructure
//! (anti-bot bypass with stealth Chrome, JS rendering at scale,
//! per-user auth, billing, async job queues, agent loops) are
//! intentionally not implemented here. Use api.webclaw.io for those.
